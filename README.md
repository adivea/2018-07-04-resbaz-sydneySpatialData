# SpatialData_ResBazSydney2018

This is a repo created for the "Exploring Spatial data with R" workshop in Advanced R stream at 2018 ResBaz
at the Macquarie Uni. 
Besides the data and template scrips in the VectorIntro and RasterIntro folders, it also contains the 
pre-June 2018 data carpentry lesson markup documents with scripts. These are mostly useful if you prefer
to use the plot() function to interact with rasters, rather than ggplot(). When introducting geospatial 
concepts and geocomputing in R, I prefer the simpler plotting.
